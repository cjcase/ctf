### Hack Your Grade

Developed for cybersec students at ITESM CQ, the main goal is to hack into the system and change your final grade.

### Story
The whole classrom has been recruited by deds3c to hit an ECorp system containing valuable data. Only known as the "blackbox" we have no clue on what is inside. Our last operative managed to give us a hint before being wasted by ECorp runners.
We think the professor might be involved in a sketchy ECorp experiment of some kind and so far we know he is holding our grades hostage inside the system.

The goal would be to hack the system all the way to the grade server, and leaving some gaps open so our friends at fsociety can get in.

The only info we have is a hash:
