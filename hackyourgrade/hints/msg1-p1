sup deds3c, my name is x0b33,
I understand your grades are being held hostage in an evilcorp blackbox.
what the fuarkk is that soykaf all about?

I did some socialeng around and I have some sweet intel you might need.
The fuarkking narc who owns the box is using the newest axtel router firmware, leakers inside the corp tell me that they fixed their psk gen code by adding 2 more bytes.

the regexp structure used to look like this:
[0-9A-F]{8}

now it should look like this:
[0-9A-F]{10}

They wouldn't get back to me when I asked if the ssid still revealed some bytes of the psk, I assume they ran off to push another soykaf update.

Your task is as follows:
crack into the wifi and do a networkmap of the whole thing, we need to know exactly how many servers are inside and how many clients, your data is being held hostage in one of those.

I'm going to need you to send me the cleaned handshake cap, we are testing a monster sli build to gpu crack the soykaf out of them and I want to try it on a real evilcorp cap.

be sure to send me an easy image diagram too, half of the troglodytes in here wouldn't know how to interpret your 1337 h4x0r tools output.

Remember, sysadmins at evilcorp check the box daily, if you attempt to do a physical exfiltration remeber to AVOID DOING ANY PHYSICAL DAMAGE. We know the box is protected with accelerometers so it logs sudden movements.

Be quick! we don't know if the corps will contact the narc to change the ssid soon!
